**Why now?** Peach trees bloom with pink flowers before their leaves appear—flowers first, foliage second. This burst of color against bare branches is striking, a celebration before the practical work of leaves.

**Insight:** The peach tree leads with beauty, not utility. It flowers before it can photosynthesize efficiently. Sometimes expression must precede function. Not everything useful looks practical at first.

**Today's practice:** Lead with expression before explanation. Let beauty precede justification.

> **💬** "The earth laughs in flowers."
