**Why now?** Winter daffodils (kinsenka) bloom in cold weather, their yellow flowers appearing as most other plants dormant. Like camellias, they bloom countercyclically.

**Insight:** Yellow flowers in winter are unexpected brightness—they don't match what we think winter should look like. Sometimes the most valuable contributions come from defying expectations.

**Today's practice:** Be bright when the world is gray. Your color matters more in contrast.
