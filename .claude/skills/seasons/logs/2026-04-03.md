**Why now?** Thunder begins to be heard in the distance—spring storms building as temperature differentials increase. The sound announces energy arriving, weather systems in motion.

**Insight:** Thunder is announcement before arrival. It tells you something is coming, gives you time to prepare. Nature provides warnings to those who listen. The rumble is information.

**Today's practice:** Notice where energy is building. What storm might be gathering?

> **💬** "You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep spring from coming."
