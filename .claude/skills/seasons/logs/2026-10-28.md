**Why now?** Light rains fall intermittently—not the heavy rains of summer but gentler, cooler showers that come and go without drama.

**Insight:** Light rain is persistent rather than intense. It doesn't make dramatic announcements but accomplishes its work through steady presence. Some things are better done gently over time.

**Today's practice:** Work gently and persistently. Light rain still waters.

> **💬** "There is something incredibly nostalgic and significant about the annual cascade of autumn leaves."
