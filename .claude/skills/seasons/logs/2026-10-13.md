**Why now?** Chrysanthemums bloom with their intricate flowers in autumn when most plants are finished blooming. They flourish in cooling weather, a symbol of longevity and the beauty of late seasons.

**Insight:** The chrysanthemum blooms when others fade—a countercyclical flower. Late seasons have their own beauty, distinct from the abundance of summer. Some things only flourish in the cooling.

**Today's practice:** Bloom in your own season, even if others are finished. Late flourishing is still flourishing.

> **💬** "How beautifully leaves grow old. How full of light and color are their last days."
