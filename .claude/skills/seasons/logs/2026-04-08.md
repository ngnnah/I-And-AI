**Why now?** Barn swallows return from their southern wintering grounds, arriving in Japan to nest. These long-distance migrants navigate thousands of miles to return to familiar places.

**Insight:** Swallows return to where they know they can thrive. Migration isn't just leaving—it's knowing where to come back to. Home can be seasonal, returned to when conditions are right.

**Today's practice:** Welcome something or someone returning to your life. Make space for the arrival.
