**Why now?** Tachibana (wild tangerines) turn yellow on the branch, their citrus brightness appearing as other colors fade. These small, bitter fruits are prized for their fragrance and longevity.

**Insight:** The tachibana offers something different from sweetness—fragrance, resilience, traditional significance. Not all value is immediate or obvious. Some gifts require appreciation of a different kind.

**Today's practice:** Cultivate something resilient. Hardiness has its own worth.
