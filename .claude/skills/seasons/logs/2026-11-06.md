**Why now?** Maples and ivy turn yellow and red as chlorophyll breaks down, revealing hidden pigments that were there all along. The fall colors are an unmasking, not a creation.

**Insight:** Autumn colors reveal what was always present, hidden by green. The tree doesn't create these pigments in fall—it stops hiding them. Sometimes beauty requires letting go of what obscures.

**Today's practice:** Stop hiding something that's actually beautiful. Let the green go.
