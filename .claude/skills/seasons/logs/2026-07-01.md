**Why now?** Japanese irises bloom in dramatic purple, blue, and white. These moisture-loving flowers thrive in rainy season conditions that challenge other plants. They're at their best when it's wet.

**Insight:** The iris doesn't just tolerate rain—it flourishes in it. Some conditions that seem adverse are actually ideal, depending on what you're growing. Find what thrives in your particular weather.

**Today's practice:** Visit water today if possible. Let wetness be welcome.
