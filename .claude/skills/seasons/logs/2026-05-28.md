**Why now?** Safflowers bloom with their brilliant orange-red flowers, traditionally used for dyeing fabric and making cosmetics. Their vivid color once made them more valuable than gold by weight.

**Insight:** The safflower holds its value in concentrated form—just a small amount produces vivid dye. Potency isn't about quantity; it's about concentration of what matters.

**Today's practice:** Notice where your unique 'dye' is—your concentrated value. Use it today.
