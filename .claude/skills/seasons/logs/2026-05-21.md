**Why now?** Silkworms begin their intensive feeding period, consuming mulberry leaves voraciously. This concentrated eating will fuel their transformation into pupae and eventually silk moths.

**Insight:** The silkworm's focused feeding isn't indulgence—it's preparation. They consume intensively because transformation requires resources. Sometimes you need to take in more before you can give out.

**Today's practice:** Feed yourself what you need for an upcoming transformation. Input precedes output.
