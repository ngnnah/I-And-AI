**Why now?** Dense fog descends in late summer mornings as cool night air meets warm ground. This fog burns off by midday but creates mysterious, enclosed hours in the early day.

**Insight:** Morning fog creates temporary intimacy—a smaller world, closer horizons. Sometimes reduced visibility is an invitation to focus on what's immediately near.

**Today's practice:** Work in a smaller world today. Reduce your visible horizon intentionally.
