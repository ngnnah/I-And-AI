**Why now?** North winds blow the last leaves from branches, completing the trees' transition to bare winter form. The wind does what gravity alone couldn't—finishes the release.

**Insight:** The north wind completes what autumn started. Sometimes completion needs outside force; internal readiness meets external push. The tree let go; the wind carried away.

**Today's practice:** Accept brisk treatment. Sometimes kindness is quick completion.

> **💬** "Be like a tree and let the dead leaves drop."
