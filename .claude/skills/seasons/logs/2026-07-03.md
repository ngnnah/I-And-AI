**Why now?** The crow-dipper (hange) sprouts as the summer solstice passes. This medicinal plant marks the transition into true summer—five days before and after the solstice.

**Insight:** Hange emerges at the pivot point of the year's longest days. It marks transition precisely, growing in the exact moment of seasonal shift. Some things exist to mark thresholds.

**Today's practice:** Notice what emerges during pivotal moments. What grows at your turning points?
