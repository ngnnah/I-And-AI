**Why now?** Cotton plants produce their flowers, soon to be followed by the cotton bolls that will be harvested for fiber. This flowering marks the beginning of the end of agricultural summer.

**Insight:** Cotton flowers are the first step toward a practical harvest—not food but fiber, not immediate but processed. Some growth is for utility discovered through transformation.

**Today's practice:** Create something that others will complete. Your flowering enables their harvest.
