**Why now?** Butterburs are among the first plants to bloom each year. While the air reaches peak cold, the soil retains warmth from autumn—these hardy flowers tap that hidden heat to get a head start before competition awakens.

**Insight:** The coldest days come _after_ the winter solstice, not before. Light has been returning for a full month now—the reversal is already underway, even when conditions feel hardest. This is the "hidden spring": change begins before evidence appears. What looks like the depths of winter is actually momentum building underground.

**Today's practice:** Identify one project or idea that's quietly building momentum beneath the surface. Give it 15 minutes of focused attention—water the roots that others can't see yet.

**💬 Quote:** "What good is the warmth of summer, without the cold of winter to give it sweetness."
— John Steinbeck
