**Why now?** While air is coldest, soil stays warmer underground. The butterbur taps this hidden warmth, blooming before competitors wake—first-mover advantage in nature's economy.

**Insight:** The coldest days come _after_ the solstice turn, not before. Light has been returning for a month—the reversal is already underway, even when conditions feel hardest. This is the "hidden spring": change begins before evidence appears.

**Today's practice:** Identify one project that's quietly building momentum beneath the surface. Give it 15 minutes of attention—water roots that others can't see yet.
