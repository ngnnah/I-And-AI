**Why now?** Impossibly, the self-heal plant sprouts new growth at the winter solstice—the darkest time. What withered in summer now emerges in winter, alive again beneath the snow.

**Insight:** Self-heal sprouts at maximum darkness—reversal begins at the extremity. The darkest moment contains the seed of light. What seems like end often contains beginning.

**Today's practice:** Begin something at the bottom. Some starts happen at endings.

> **💬** "The snow itself is lonely or, if you prefer, self-sufficient. There is no other time when the whole world seems composed of one thing and one thing only."
> — Joseph Wood Krutch
