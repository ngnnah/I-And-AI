**Why now?** Bears enter their dens for winter hibernation, slowing metabolism dramatically to survive months without eating. This withdrawal is survival strategy, not defeat.

**Insight:** The bear doesn't fight winter—it yields, slows, waits. Hibernation is active conservation, not passive giving up. Sometimes the wise response to harsh conditions is dramatic reduction.

**Today's practice:** Conserve for a hard season. Strategic withdrawal is strength.
