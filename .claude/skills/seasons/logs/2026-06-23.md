**Why now?** The self-heal plant (natsukarekusa) withers in summer heat despite its name—'summer-withering grass.' It blooms in late spring, then dies back as solstice approaches, resting through heat.

**Insight:** Self-heal teaches strategic retreat. It doesn't fight summer—it withdraws, knowing its strength is in another season. Sometimes wisdom is knowing when to wither, conserving energy for better conditions.

**Today's practice:** Identify where you're fighting the season instead of adapting to it. Consider retreat.

> **💬** "One must maintain a little bit of summer, even in the middle of winter."
> — Henry David Thoreau
