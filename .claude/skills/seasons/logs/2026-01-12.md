**Why now?** Deep underground springs begin to warm slightly as geothermal heat persists even as surface freezes. Water emerges warmer than the air, steaming in cold mornings.

**Insight:** Springs flow from depths that surface cold can't reach. Deep sources continue when surfaces freeze. Your deepest resources may be more stable than your circumstances suggest.

**Today's practice:** Find warmth at the source. Go deeper when the surface freezes.
