**Why now?** Cold sets in firmly now—no longer tentative frost but established winter. The sky feels closer, the air denser with cold. Winter declares itself.

**Insight:** Established cold is different from approaching cold. Once set in, winter isn't coming—it's here. Acceptance shifts from anticipating to inhabiting.

**Today's practice:** Settle into the season. Some things are best accepted, not resisted.

> **💬** "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."
