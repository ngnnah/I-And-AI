**Why now?** Thunder ceases as autumn deepens—the atmospheric conditions that created summer storms no longer align. The quiet absence of thunder marks a seasonal shift.

**Insight:** The end of thunder is noticed by its absence. We often mark arrivals more than departures, beginnings more than endings. But what stops is as significant as what starts.

**Today's practice:** Listen for what's missing. What thunder has ceased in your life?
