**Why now?** Sparrows begin building nests, gathering materials and selecting sites. This industrious work happens while spring is still young—preparation for what's coming, not reaction to what's here.

**Insight:** The sparrow doesn't wait until eggs are ready to build the nest. It prepares for what it knows will come. Wisdom is action taken in anticipation, not just in response.

**Today's practice:** Start infrastructure work on something. Foundation before flourish.
