**Why now?** Ice reaches its maximum thickness on streams and ponds—the accumulation of cold nights over weeks. This is the depth of winter's grip.

**Insight:** Ice thickens through patient accumulation—each cold night adds a layer. Depth comes from persistence, not single events. The most solid structures build slowly.

**Today's practice:** Stand on something solid you've built. Trust the ice that formed through persistence.
