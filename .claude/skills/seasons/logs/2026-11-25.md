**Why now?** Rainbows become rare as the low winter sun and infrequent rain reduce the geometry needed for their formation. The light phenomena 'hides' until conditions return.

**Insight:** Rainbows hide because conditions don't support them—light too low, rain too rare. Some beautiful things are seasonal not because they're fragile but because they require specific circumstances.

**Today's practice:** Appreciate available beauty rather than mourning unavailable beauty.
