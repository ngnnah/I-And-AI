**Why now?** Wild geese return from their northern breeding grounds to winter in Japan. Their V-formations overhead announce autumn's deepening—the same birds that left in spring now return.

**Insight:** The geese return to where they know they can survive winter. Migration is about matching location to season—being where conditions support you, moving when they change.

**Today's practice:** Return to something you left when conditions weren't right. Check if the season has changed.
