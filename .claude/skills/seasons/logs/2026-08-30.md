**Why now?** Summer's heat begins to die down as the sun's angle lowers. Days are still warm but lack the intensity of peak summer. The limit has been reached; decline begins.

**Insight:** Peaks pass by definition—they're the point beyond which decline begins. Recognizing the limit of heat is recognizing that intensity cannot be sustained indefinitely. Relief is approaching.

**Today's practice:** Prepare for a calmer phase. What will you do with reduced intensity?
