**Why now?** Reeds begin pushing up from wetlands and riverbanks. These tall grasses will eventually form dense stands, but now they're just green spears emerging from mud.

**Insight:** Reeds are one of the fastest-growing plants—gaining visible height daily. But they start in mud, not despite it. Their growth medium looks unpromising, yet it provides exactly what they need.

**Today's practice:** Measure growth that others might not see yet. Track your own daily progress.
