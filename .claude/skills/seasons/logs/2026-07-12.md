**Why now?** Lotus flowers open in ponds and temple gardens, blooming from murky water with pristine petals. This emergence of purity from mud is a central Buddhist symbol.

**Insight:** The lotus needs mud to bloom—it's not despite the murk, but because of it. Nutrients in dark water feed the pristine flower. Our difficult circumstances may be feeding something beautiful.

**Today's practice:** Find nourishment in difficult circumstances. What's feeding you that looks like mud?
