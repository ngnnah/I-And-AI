**Why now?** Crickets chirp in doorways as nights cool, seeking residual warmth from human dwellings. Their song is a familiar autumn sound, associated with nostalgia and seasonal change.

**Insight:** Crickets at the threshold—not quite inside, not outside—sing at the edge. Boundaries are where life often gathers, seeking the best of both conditions.

**Today's practice:** Notice what gathers at your doorway. What's seeking warmth from your environment?

> **💬** "The old pond—a frog jumps in, sound of water."
