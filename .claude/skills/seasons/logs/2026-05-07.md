**Why now?** Frogs begin their chorus as temperatures warm. The songs of male frogs fill evening air near ponds and rice paddies, announcing the start of breeding season.

**Insight:** Frogs don't wait for permission to sing—they respond to conditions. When warmth arrives, they raise their voices. They're not performing; they're participating in the season.

**Today's practice:** Announce yourself tonight. Let the day end with expression, not just completion.

> **💬** "In summer, the song sings itself."
