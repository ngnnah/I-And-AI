**Why now?** Paulownia trees produce their seeds in summer heat, preparing for autumn dispersal. These fast-growing trees are traditionally planted when a daughter is born, harvested for her wedding furniture when she marries.

**Insight:** The paulownia grows fast but is planted with long-term intent. Speed and patience aren't opposites—they serve different time horizons. Some things grow quickly toward distant goals.

**Today's practice:** Consider what you're building for the next generation.
