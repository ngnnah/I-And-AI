**Why now?** Around February 4th, the east wind—warmer air from the Pacific—begins to blow across Japan. This wind carries enough warmth to start melting ice at the edges. It's not spring yet, but the first messenger has arrived.

**Insight:** The calendar marks spring's beginning while winter still holds firm. This teaches us that beginnings are declarations of intent, not descriptions of current reality. The east wind is a promise, not a proof. Sometimes we must announce our direction before circumstances align.

**Today's practice:** Declare an intention for something you want to begin, even if conditions aren't perfect yet. Write it down.
