**Why now?** While the air reaches its coldest, the earth below stays warmer. Butterbur taps this hidden warmth to bloom before other plants awaken—a first-mover advantage written into nature's playbook.

**Insight:** We're deep in Major Cold, yet the winter solstice passed a month ago. Light has been quietly returning. The reversal is already underway, invisible beneath harsh conditions. This is the 'hidden spring'—change begins before evidence appears. Your hardest moments may already contain the seeds of what comes next.

**Today's practice:** Look for warmth in unexpected places today. The surface isn't the whole story.
