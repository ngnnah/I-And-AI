**Why now?** Wheat reaches maturity and farmers begin harvest. This 'wheat autumn' comes as other plants are still in spring—different crops have different timelines, and harvest happens when ready, not by calendar.

**Insight:** Wheat's harvest in late spring reminds us that seasons are species-specific. Your timeline isn't everyone's timeline. Maturity arrives when preparation meets conditions, regardless of what others are doing.

**Today's practice:** Harvest something that's ready, even if it's 'off-season' for others.
