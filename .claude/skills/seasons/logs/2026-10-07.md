**Why now?** Farmers drain rice paddies to dry the fields for harvest. Water that sustained growth all summer now must leave so the crop can be collected.

**Insight:** Draining the fields is essential for harvest—what nurtured growth now impedes collection. Conditions for cultivation differ from conditions for harvest. The transition requires different care.

**Today's practice:** Accept that what helped growth may hinder harvest. Transition requirements shift.
