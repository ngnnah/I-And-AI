**Why now?** The last frost passes and rice seedlings can safely be transplanted into paddies. Farmers watch temperature carefully—too early and seedlings freeze, too late and the growing season shortens.

**Insight:** Timing matters immensely for rice farmers. They don't rush, but they don't delay either. The window exists; the task is recognizing it and acting within it. Patience and decisiveness aren't opposites.

**Today's practice:** Identify a 'last frost' in your timeline—a constraint that defines when you must act. Plan around it.
