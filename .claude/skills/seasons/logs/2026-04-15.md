**Why now?** Spring conditions—sun and rain together—create the geometry for rainbows. These first rainbows of the year mark the return of a phenomenon impossible in winter's dry or frozen air.

**Insight:** Rainbows require specific conditions: light, moisture, and the right angle of observation. When these align, something invisible becomes visible. The spectrum was always there; circumstances revealed it.

**Today's practice:** Look for something beautiful that only appears under specific conditions. Create those conditions.
