**Why now?** Young hawks leave their nests and begin learning to fly and hunt. This period of clumsy practice is essential—they must fail repeatedly before they become skilled predators.

**Insight:** Hawks aren't born able to hunt—they learn through awkward attempts and frequent failure. Mastery requires a period of incompetence. The expert was once the beginner falling from branches.

**Today's practice:** Practice something clumsily today. Let yourself be a beginner.
