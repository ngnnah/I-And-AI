**Why now?** Caterpillars that pupated in autumn now emerge as butterflies. The transformation happened in darkness, unseen. What crawled now flies—same creature, completely changed form.

**Insight:** Metamorphosis isn't improvement; it's total reorganization. The caterpillar didn't become a better caterpillar—it became something else entirely. Some growth requires dissolution before reconstitution.

**Today's practice:** Identify one way you've transformed, not just improved. Honor the magnitude of change.
