**Why now?** Higurashi (evening cicadas) begin their distinctive singing at dusk, a melancholic sound associated with late summer and the approaching end of the season.

**Insight:** The higurashi sings at day's end, marking transition from light to dark. Its song is beautiful and sad—the beauty of endings, the recognition that this won't last.

**Today's practice:** Create something appropriate for dusk—a closing activity, a winding down.

> **💬** "The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear."
