**Why now?** As ice thins, fish that sheltered in deeper, warmer water begin rising toward the surface. They emerge through gaps in the ice, drawn by increasing light and oxygen. Life moves upward, toward the sun.

**Insight:** The fish don't break through the ice—they find where it has already thinned. Emergence requires both readiness and finding the right opening. Sometimes patience means waiting for the gap, not forcing the breakthrough.

**Today's practice:** Surface something you've kept submerged—a thought, a project, a conversation that's ready to emerge.
