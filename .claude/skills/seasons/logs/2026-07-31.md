**Why now?** Earth is damp from rain while air grows humid and hot—the combination creates uncomfortable, sticky days. This 'steaming' period is when both moisture and heat are at their peak.

**Insight:** Discomfort peaks when multiple intensities combine. Humid heat is harder than dry heat; wet cold is harder than dry cold. Combinations create experiences beyond their components.

**Today's practice:** Accept that peak intensity passes. This is not forever.

> **💬** "Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day is by no means a waste of time."
