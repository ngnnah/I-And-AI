**Why now?** Plums reach ripeness, turning from green to yellow. This is the season for making umeboshi (pickled plums) and umeshu (plum wine)—preserving summer's abundance for the year ahead.

**Insight:** Ripe plums must be processed quickly—their moment of perfection is brief. Preservation extends this moment's value into the future. Capture abundance when it arrives; store it skillfully.

**Today's practice:** Process an abundance before it spoils. Don't let surplus become waste.
