**Why now?** Pheasants begin to call as days lengthen—their mating calls are among the first bird sounds to break winter's quiet. They sense the turn before it's visible.

**Insight:** The pheasant calls in response to lengthening light, not warming temperature. It reads the true signal, not the obvious one. Some changes are better detected through subtle indicators.

**Today's practice:** Notice lengthening days. What small change carries the important message?

> **💬** "Winter is the time for comfort, for good food and warmth, for the touch of a friendly hand and for a talk beside the fire."
