**Why now?** The ground begins to freeze at the surface, first in thin layers overnight that thaw by midday, then increasingly firm as cold deepens.

**Insight:** Freezing happens in layers—surface first, then gradually deeper. Slow change is still change. The imperceptible progress of cold eventually becomes hardness.

**Today's practice:** Notice gradual change. Slow doesn't mean nothing—it means building.
