**Why now?** Earthworms surface as soil warms, their tunneling visible in fresh castings. These essential creatures aerate soil and process organic matter, doing vital work mostly unseen.

**Insight:** Worms do critical work underground, out of sight. Their contribution is enormous but unglamorous. Not all important work is visible; some of the most essential processes happen below the surface.

**Today's practice:** Appreciate infrastructure—the systems and people that make visible work possible.
