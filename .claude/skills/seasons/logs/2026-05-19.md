**Why now?** Bamboo shoots push through soil with tremendous force—some species can grow nearly a meter in a single day. This growth was prepared by the root system for years; expression is sudden but preparation was long.

**Insight:** The bamboo shoot's rapid growth is backed by years of root development. What looks like overnight success has deep preparation beneath it. Speed comes from foundation.

**Today's practice:** Eat bamboo shoots if possible—consume the lesson literally.

> **💬** "A society grows great when old people plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in."
