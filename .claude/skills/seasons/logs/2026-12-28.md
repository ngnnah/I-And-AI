**Why now?** Male deer shed their antlers in winter, a dramatic loss that seems like diminishment but is actually normal cycling. New antlers will grow in spring, larger than before.

**Insight:** Shedding antlers isn't loss—it's the precondition for better growth. What you let go of creates space for what comes next, often larger than what you released.

**Today's practice:** Trust that what you shed will regrow. This loss is part of a cycle.
