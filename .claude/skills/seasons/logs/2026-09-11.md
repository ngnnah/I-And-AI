**Why now?** Morning dew forms thicker now, glistening white on grass as nights cool. This 'white dew' is visible evidence of autumn's approach—water condensing on surfaces that couldn't cool enough in summer.

**Insight:** Dew reveals what was always there—moisture in the air, made visible by cooling. The water didn't arrive; conditions changed to reveal it. Sometimes our circumstances must shift before we see what's present.

**Today's practice:** Cool down emotionally. What appears when intensity drops?
