### "Butterburs bud"

> January 20-24 · 大寒 Daikan (Major Cold)

**Why now?** While surface air reaches its coldest point of the year, soil deeper underground retains warmth from months of accumulated summer heat. The butterbur's roots tap this hidden thermal reserve, sending up flower stalks before any competitor even stirs—first-mover advantage in nature's economy.

**Insight:** The coldest days come _after_ the solstice turn, not before. Light has been returning for a full month now—the reversal is well underway, even when conditions feel hardest. This is the "hidden spring": potential precedes manifestation. What you're building may already be growing roots while the surface looks barren.

**Today's practice:** Identify one project that's quietly building momentum beneath the surface. Give it 15 minutes of focused attention—water roots that others can't see yet.
