**Why now?** First frost appears on exposed surfaces—grass, car windows, fallen leaves. This thin white coating marks winter's first physical touch, killing tender plants and signaling coming cold.

**Insight:** Frost is winter's first mark on the landscape. It transforms what it touches, ending some lives while beginning a new phase. The first touch of change is often the hardest.

**Today's practice:** See beauty in frost—the crystalline transformation of what it touches.
