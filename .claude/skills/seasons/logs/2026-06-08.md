**Why now?** Praying mantis egg cases hatch, releasing hundreds of tiny mantises. These predators will grow to be important controllers of garden pests, but now they're minuscule and vulnerable.

**Insight:** The mantis starts small but is already a hunter. Form follows function from the beginning—it doesn't become a predator, it was always one. Your nature is present from the start, even in miniature.

**Today's practice:** Protect something vulnerable that has potential. Guard the hatchling.
