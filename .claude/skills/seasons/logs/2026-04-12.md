**Why now?** Wild geese that wintered in Japan now fly north to their breeding grounds. Their V-formations cross the sky, each bird taking turns at the front to share the work of leading.

**Insight:** Geese rotate leadership because no single bird can lead indefinitely. Sustainable progress requires sharing the effort. The one who leads now will follow later—and both roles serve the whole.

**Today's practice:** Notice who's doing the heavy lifting in a group. Offer to spell them.
