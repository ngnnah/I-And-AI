**Why now?** As days lengthen, hens respond to increasing light by beginning to lay eggs again. After a winter pause, production resumes—not because of warmth but because of light.

**Insight:** Hens respond to light, not temperature. They read the signal that matters for their biology. Sometimes we're tracking the wrong indicator for readiness—what truly signals your next phase?

**Today's practice:** Trust biological rhythms. Your body knows things your mind might miss.
