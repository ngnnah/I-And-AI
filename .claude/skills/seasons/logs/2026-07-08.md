**Why now?** Warm winds from the south blow across Japan, bringing humid heat. These aren't gentle breezes but substantial movements of hot air—summer declaring itself fully.

**Insight:** Warm wind is energy in motion, heat transferred from one place to another. Summer doesn't ask permission—it arrives with force. Sometimes arrival is assertive, not subtle.

**Today's practice:** Move something with force—an idea, a project, a stalled situation. Be the warm wind.
