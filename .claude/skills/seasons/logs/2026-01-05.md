**Why now?** Japanese parsley (seri) flourishes in cold water—it thrives in conditions that most plants avoid. This winter vegetable is prized for its fresh flavor in the cold months.

**Insight:** Seri thrives in cold water, finding advantage where others struggle. Specific adaptation creates niche opportunity. Your unusual preference might be your competitive advantage.

**Today's practice:** Find your cold water—the conditions where you thrive that others avoid.
