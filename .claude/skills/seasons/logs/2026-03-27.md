**Why now?** Cherry blossoms begin opening across Japan, triggering hanami (flower viewing) celebrations. The blooms last only a week or two, making their beauty precious through impermanence.

**Insight:** Cherry blossoms are celebrated not despite their brevity, but because of it. Their transience is their teaching. We pay attention because we know they'll pass. What if we treated all beautiful moments this way?

**Today's practice:** Celebrate an ending as you would a beginning. Honor the full arc.
