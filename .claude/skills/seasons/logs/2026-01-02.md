**Why now?** Wheat planted in autumn sprouts beneath the snow, growing slowly in cold that would kill other crops. This winter wheat uses the dormant season productively.

**Insight:** Wheat under snow is working—slowly, invisibly, but actively growing toward future harvest. Some progress happens out of sight, in conditions that look inhospitable.

**Today's practice:** Use a quiet time productively. Dormancy isn't always dormant.

> **💬** "Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare."
