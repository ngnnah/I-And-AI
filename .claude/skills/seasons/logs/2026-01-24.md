**Why now?** While the air reaches its coldest, the earth below stays warmer. Butterbur taps this hidden warmth to bloom before other plants awaken—a first-mover advantage written into nature's playbook.

**Insight:** Today is the final day of this kō. The coldest period peaks while light has been returning for over a month. This is nature's paradox: the harshest conditions arrive _after_ the turn has begun. What feels like deepening winter is actually spring building beneath the surface.

**Today's practice:** Notice something in your work that's further along than conditions suggest. Trust the trajectory over the temperature.
