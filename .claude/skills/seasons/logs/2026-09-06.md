**Why now?** Rice in the paddies ripens and begins to turn golden. Months of growth reach their culmination—the grain is ready or nearly ready for harvest.

**Insight:** Ripening is the conversion of growth into yield. All the water, sun, and care now becomes something harvestable. The work shifts from cultivation to collection.

**Today's practice:** Trust that your work is reaching fruition. The grain remembers every day of growth.
