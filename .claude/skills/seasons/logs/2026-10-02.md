**Why now?** Insects sense the cooling and begin to hide in the ground, sealing entrances to their burrows. Life prepares for winter by going underground, invisible but present.

**Insight:** The insects don't die—they hide. They'll be there all winter, in reduced form, waiting. What disappears from view isn't necessarily gone; it may be preserving itself in places we can't see.

**Today's practice:** Prepare your shelter. Winter is coming; is your burrow ready?

> **💬** "In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure."
> — Confucius
