**Why now?** Swallows that arrived in spring now depart for their southern wintering grounds. The birds that announced spring's arrival now announce autumn's deepening.

**Insight:** Departure completes the cycle begun by arrival. The swallows go; they'll return next spring. Not everything stays—some visitors are seasonal by nature, and their leaving is as much part of the rhythm as their coming.

**Today's practice:** Let something leave that came for a season. Don't hold what needs to go.

> **💬** "Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day."
