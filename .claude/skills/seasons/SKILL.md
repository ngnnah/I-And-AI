# /seasons

Display the current Japanese micro-season (kō 候) to foster seasonal awareness and connection to nature.

## Instructions

1. **Check if today's log exists**: Look for `./logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - **If exists**: Read and display the log file contents, then stop (no regeneration)
   - **If not**: Continue with steps below
2. **Determine today's date** and find the matching kō from the reference below
3. **Display the current micro-season** in a clean, compact format
4. **Include a brief ELI5 insight** (2-3 sentences max) explaining the natural phenomenon
5. **Add a positive contemplation** that:
   - Connects nature's wisdom to human growth and work
   - Frames challenges as opportunities
   - Suggests an actionable mindset or practice
6. **Include the pre-selected quote** from the kō reference table below
7. **Include relevant resources** (1-2 links) for deeper exploration
8. **Save output to log file**: `./logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

See `sekki-explanations.md` for detailed ELI5 explanations of each solar term.

## Output Format

```
## 第{number}候 · {romaji}
### "{english translation}"

> {date range} · {sekki name} ({sekki english})

<img src="../images/{number}-{slug}.jpg" alt="{description}" width="480">

**Why now?** {1-2 sentence ELI5 of the natural phenomenon}

**Insight:** {Positive philosophical musing connecting nature to
work/life—focus on growth, opportunity, patience, timing, etc.}

**Today's practice:** {One small actionable suggestion to embody
this seasonal wisdom in your work}

> **💬** "{Quote from the kō reference table}"
> — {Author from the kō reference table}

**Learn more:**
- {Relevant article, video, or resource URL}
- {Optional second resource}
```

## Images & Resources

This skill is self-contained with local images and curated URLs.

### Image Strategy

All 72 images are available locally. Always include the image in log files.

**Log file path**: Use `../images/` (logs are in `./logs/` subdirectory)

```html
<img src="../images/{number}-{slug}.jpg" alt="{description}" width="480" />
```

### Local Images

- All 72 images stored in: `./images/{number}-{romaji-slug}.jpg`
- Example: `./images/70-fuki-no-hana-saku.jpg`
- Git-tracked for portability

### Curated URLs

- See `./resources.md` for specific "Learn more" URLs for each kō
- Each micro-season has a validated Wikipedia/Japan Guide link

## Logging

Each /seasons output is saved as a markdown log file for tracking over time.

### Log Location

`./logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Example: `./logs/2026-01-22.md`

### Log Format

Save the complete output to the log file. One file per day.

**Important:** Use `../images/` for image paths in logs (not `./images/`).

### Purpose

- Build a personal seasonal journal
- Track contemplations and practices over time
- Review patterns across seasons
- Git-tracked for history

## The 72 Kō Reference

Each micro-season has a pre-selected quote that resonates with its natural phenomenon and philosophical theme.

## Example Output

For January 22 (kō #70):

## 第70候 · Fuki no hana saku

### "Butterburs bud"

> January 20-24 · 大寒 Daikan (Major Cold)

<img src="../images/70-fuki-no-hana-saku.jpg" alt="Butterbur buds emerging through cold earth" width="480">

**Why now?** While air is coldest, soil stays warmer underground. The butterbur taps this hidden warmth, blooming before competitors wake—first-mover advantage in nature's economy.

**Insight:** The coldest days come _after_ the solstice turn, not before. Light has been returning for a month—the reversal is already underway, even when conditions feel hardest. This is the "hidden spring": change begins before evidence appears.

**Today's practice:** Identify one project that's quietly building momentum beneath the surface. Give it 15 minutes of attention—water roots that others can't see yet.

> **💬** "In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer."
> — Albert Camus
