# /commit

Create a git commit with a well-crafted message.

## Instructions

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` to see changes
2. If nothing is staged, ask user what to stage or stage all with `git add -A`
3. Analyze the changes and create a commit message that:
   - Starts with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor)
   - Summarizes the "why" not just the "what"
   - Keeps first line under 72 characters
4. Commit with the message
5. Show the commit hash when done
