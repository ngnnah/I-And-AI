## Current Documentation

All information from these files has been synthesized into the main [README.md](../README.md), which now serves as the single source of truth for:

- Game overview and how to play
- Quick start deployment guide
- Technical architecture
- Testing and quality assurance
- Troubleshooting
- Future enhancements
- Project metrics

## Why Archived?

These files served their purpose during development but created documentation fragmentation. The unified README provides:
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Better organization
- ✅ Easier maintenance
- ✅ Cleaner workspace
