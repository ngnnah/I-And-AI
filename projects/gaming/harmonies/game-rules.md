## Setup

### Multiplayer Setup (2-4 Players)

1. **Central Board:** Place with 2-4 player side face up
2. **Pouch:** Put all 120 tokens in the pouch and mix them
3. **Initial Tokens:** Draw tokens randomly and place **3 tokens on each space** on the Central Board (typically 5 spaces)
4. **Animal Cards:**
   - Shuffle all animal cards
   - Place **5 cards face up** next to the Central Board
   - Place remaining cards face down as draw pile
   - Place animal cubes next to the draw pile
5. **Personal Boards:**
   - Each player takes one Personal Board
   - All players use the **same side** (A or B)
   - Recommended: Use **Side A** for first games
6. **Reminder Cards:** Each player takes one, matching the board side being used
7. **Start Player:** Last player to see a magnificent landscape starts (or choose randomly)
   - Point the arrow on Central Board toward start player

### Solo Setup

1. Use **solo side** of Central Board (3 spaces instead of 5)
2. Place **3 animal cards** face up (not 5)
3. Otherwise same as multiplayer setup

---

## Turn Structure

On your turn, you perform **one mandatory action** and up to **two optional actions**. You can take these actions **in any order you prefer**.

### Actions Available

#### 1. Take and Place Tokens (MANDATORY - Once Per Turn)

**Taking Tokens:**

- Choose one of the spaces on the Central Board
- Take **all 3 tokens** from that space
- You must place all 3 tokens on your Personal Board during your turn

**Placing Tokens:**

- You can place tokens **between other actions** (doesn't have to be all at once)
- Follow the Token Placement Rules (see section below)
- Tokens can be placed on empty hexes or stacked according to stacking rules

#### 2. Take One Animal Card (OPTIONAL - Max Once Per Turn)

- Choose one of the face-up Animal Cards
- Place it above your Personal Board
- You can have **maximum 4 Animal Cards** above your board at once
- Cannot take a card if you already have 4 cards
- Look at the number in the top right corner of the card
- Take that many Animal Cubes and place **one cube on each space** along the right edge

#### 3. Place Animal Cube(s) (OPTIONAL - Multiple Times)

- Can be done multiple times during your turn
- Match patterns shown on your Animal Cards (see Animal Cards section)
- When you match a pattern, take the **bottom-most cube** from that card
- Place it on the corresponding hex as shown in the pattern
- Once all cubes are placed from a card, move it to the side of your board (frees up a card slot)

### End of Turn

1. **Refill Central Board:** Draw 3 tokens from pouch, fill the space you took from
2. **Refill Animal Cards:** If fewer than 5 face up, flip more until 5 are visible
3. **Next Player's Turn**

---

## Token Placement Rules

### Basic Placement

1. **Empty Hexes:** Any color token can be placed on an empty hex
2. **Stacking:** Tokens can be stacked according to specific rules (see below)
3. **Maximum Height:** Stacks can be **maximum 3 tokens high**
4. **No Moving:** Once placed, tokens cannot be moved or removed
5. **No Stacking Under:** You cannot place a token underneath an existing token
6. **Animal Cubes Block:** Once an Animal Cube is placed on a hex, you cannot stack more tokens there

### Stacking Rules by Color

| Token Color          | Can Be Placed On    | Max Stack Height | Notes                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yellow (Fields)**  | Ground only         | 1                | Cannot stack on anything, nothing can stack on it         |
| **Blue (Water)**     | Ground only         | 1                | Cannot stack on anything, nothing can stack on it         |
| **Brown (Trunks)**   | Brown only          | 2                | Can only stack on other brown. Max 2 brown in a stack     |
| **Green (Leaves)**   | 1 or 2 Brown        | 3                | Must have brown underneath. Can be on 1 or 2 brown tokens |
| **Gray (Mountains)** | Gray only           | 3                | Can only stack on other gray tokens                       |
| **Red (Buildings)**  | Gray, Brown, or Red | 2                | Can be placed alone OR as 2nd token. Never 3rd in a stack |

### Stacking Examples

**Valid Stacks:**

- Yellow (alone)
- Blue (alone)
- Brown (alone)
- Brown → Brown (2-high trunk)
- Brown → Green (2-high tree)
- Brown → Brown → Green (3-high tree)
- Green (alone on ground - counts as tree)
- Gray (alone)
- Gray → Gray (2-high mountain)
- Gray → Gray → Gray (3-high mountain)
- Brown → Red (building on trunk)
- Gray → Red (building on rock)
- Red (alone on ground - building)

**Invalid Stacks:**

- Yellow → anything (yellow cannot be stacked on)
- Blue → anything (blue cannot be stacked on)
- Brown → Yellow → anything (brown cannot stack on yellow)
- Green → anything (green can't have tokens above)
- Brown → Brown → Brown (max 2 brown)
- Brown → Brown → Brown → Green (max 2 brown under green)
- Gray → Red → anything (red can only be 2nd token)
- Red → Red → Red (red can only be 2nd token)

---

## Animal Cards

### Card Anatomy

Each Animal Card shows:

- **Animal name and icon**
- **Pattern** (bottom): Shows hexes in specific terrain arrangement
- **Cube spaces** (right edge): Numbered spaces showing points
- **Max placements**: Usually 4-5 cubes per card

### Pattern Matching Rules

1. **Any Orientation:** Patterns can be matched in any rotation or mirrored
2. **Exact Height:** For trees and mountains, the height must exactly match the pattern
3. **Buildings Flexible:** Red tokens in patterns mean "any type of building"
   - Can be red alone, red on brown, or red on gray
4. **No Cube Conflict:** The hex where you'll place the cube must not already have a cube
5. **Same Token Multiple Use:** The same hex can be part of multiple animal patterns
   - But only one Animal Cube can be placed on each hex

### Placing Animal Cubes

When you match a pattern:

1. Take the **bottom-most** cube from that card (highest number visible)
2. Place it on the **designated hex** shown in the pattern (usually marked)
3. Once placed, cubes stay **permanently** (even if pattern is later broken)
4. When all cubes are removed from a card, move it aside (opens a card slot)

### Pattern Permanence

- Once placed, Animal Cubes stay on the board
- You can stack tokens that break the original pattern
- The cube remains and still scores

---

## Scoring

Score your landscape at the end of the game. Each category scores independently.

### 1. Trees (Brown + Green Tokens)

Trees are made from brown trunk tokens and green leaf tokens.

**Scoring Table:**

| Stack Composition    | Points |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| 1 Brown (trunk only) | 0      |
| 2 Brown (trunk only) | 0      |
| 1 Green (on ground)  | 1      |
| 1 Brown + 1 Green    | 3      |
| 2 Brown + 1 Green    | 5      |

**Key Points:**

- Brown tokens alone (trunks) are worth 0 points
- Need green on top to score
- Taller trees score more points

**Example:**

- 2 brown trunks = 0 pts
- 1 lone green = 1 pt
- 3 two-high trees (brown+green) = 9 pts
- 2 three-high trees (brown+brown+green) = 10 pts
- **Total: 20 points**

### 2. Mountains (Gray Tokens)

Mountains are gray tokens (1, 2, or 3 stacked). **Critical: Mountains must be adjacent to at least one other mountain to score.**

**Scoring Table:**

| Stack Height | Adjacent to Mountain | Points |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| 1 Gray       | Yes                  | 1      |
| 2 Gray       | Yes                  | 3      |
| 3 Gray       | Yes                  | 7      |
| Any Height   | No (isolated)        | 0      |

**Key Points:**

- Single gray tokens count as mountains for scoring (worth 1 pt if adjacent)
- All mountains (1, 2, or 3 gray tokens) must be adjacent to another mountain to score
- Isolated mountains score **0 points** regardless of height
- "Adjacent" = directly touching (6 possible neighbors in hex grid)

**Example:**

- 3-high mountain (isolated) = 0 pts
- 1-high next to 2-high = 1 pt
- 2-high next to 2-high = 3 pts
- 3-high next to 1-high = 7 pts
- **Total: 11 points**

### 3. Fields (Yellow Tokens)

Fields are groups of 2 or more yellow tokens connected together.

**Scoring:**

- Each field of **2 or more connected yellow tokens** = **5 points (flat)**
- Size doesn't matter - 2 yellows = same as 10 yellows
- Single isolated yellow tokens score **0 points** (need 2+ connected to form a scoring field)

**Strategy:**

- Better to make multiple small fields than one large field
- 4 fields of 2 yellows = 20 points
- 1 field of 8 yellows = 5 points

**Example:**

- Field of 2 yellows = 5 pts
- Field of 4 yellows = 5 pts
- Field of 3 yellows = 5 pts
- 1 isolated yellow = 0 pts
- **Total: 15 points (3 fields)**

### 4. Buildings (Red Tokens)

Buildings are red tokens (alone or stacked on brown/gray). They score based on **neighbor diversity**.

**Scoring:**

- **5 points per building** IF surrounded by **3 or more different colors**
- 0 points if less than 3 different colors
- Only the **top token** of each stack counts as the color
- Another red building counts as one of the different colors

**Key Points:**

- "Surrounded" = adjacent hexes (up to 6 neighbors)
- Must have at least 3 different top colors among neighbors
- Buildings in isolated areas rarely score

**Example:**

- Building with 2 neighbor colors = 0 pts
- Building with 3 neighbor colors (yellow, blue, brown) = 5 pts
- Building with 4 neighbor colors = 5 pts (still just 5)
- **Total: 5 points**

### 5. Water (Blue Tokens)

Water scoring depends on which **side of the Personal Board** you're using.

#### Side A: Rivers (Longest Path Only)

Rivers are connected blue tokens. **Only your longest river scores.**

**Scoring Table:**

| River Length | Points                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 token      | 0                           |
| 2 tokens     | 2                           |
| 3 tokens     | 5                           |
| 4 tokens     | 8                           |
| 5 tokens     | 11                          |
| 6 tokens     | 15                          |
| 7+ tokens    | 15 + 4 per additional token |

**Key Points:**

- Count shortest path between endpoints
- If river branches, use shortest path
- Multiple rivers? Only longest counts
- 7 tokens = 19 pts, 8 tokens = 23 pts, etc.

**Example:**

- River of 5 tokens = 11 pts
- River of 3 tokens = doesn't count (only longest)
- **Total: 11 points**

#### Side B: Islands (Land Areas)

Islands are land areas separated by water.

**Scoring:**

- **5 points per island**
- An island is any group of connected land hexes
- You always have at least 1 island (even with no water)
- More water divisions = more islands

**Example:**

- 2 water tokens create 3 separate islands = 15 pts

### 6. Animal Cards

Score each Animal Card based on how many cubes you placed from it.

**Scoring:**

- Look at the **top-most visible number** on each card
- If no cubes placed = 0 points
- Each card has progressive scoring (more cubes = more points)

**Example Card Values:**

- 4 cubes placed = 14 pts (all cubes removed)
- 3 cubes placed = 10 pts
- 2 cubes placed = 6 pts
- 1 cube placed = 3 pts
- 0 cubes placed = 0 pts

**Example:**

- Card 1: All 4 cubes placed = 14 pts
- Card 2: 3 of 4 placed = 10 pts
- Card 3: 2 of 4 placed = 6 pts
- Card 4: 0 placed = 0 pts
- **Total: 30 points**

### Total Score Calculation

Add all categories:

- Trees: \_\_\_ pts
- Mountains: \_\_\_ pts
- Fields: \_\_\_ pts
- Buildings: \_\_\_ pts
- Water: \_\_\_ pts
- Animal Cards: \_\_\_ pts
- **TOTAL: \_\_\_ pts**

---

## End Game

### Triggering End Game

The game ends when **either** condition is met at the end of a turn:

1. **Pouch Empty:** Fewer than 3 tokens remain to refill the Central Board
2. **Board Full:** A player has **2 or fewer empty spaces** on their Personal Board

### Final Round

- All players must take **equal number of turns**
- If end game triggers, remaining players each take **one more turn**
- Then proceed to final scoring

### Determining Winner

1. **Highest Score Wins**
2. **Tie-breaker:** Player with most Animal Cubes placed wins
3. **Still Tied:** Players share victory

---

## Advanced Rules (Optional)

### Nature Spirit Cards

_Recommended for experienced players only._

#### Setup

- Each player receives 2 Nature Spirit Cards face down
- On first turn, choose 1 to keep, return other to box
- Counts as one of your 4 Animal Card slots
- Place 1 Nature Spirit Cube on the card

#### Gameplay

- Place cube when pattern is matched (like animal cards)
- Move card aside when cube is placed

#### Scoring

- Only scores if cube was placed
- Scores based on specific landscapes created (varies by card)
- Two types:
  1. **Count specific features:** e.g., "+3 pts per 2-high tree"
  2. **Count groups:** e.g., "+10 pts per field of 3+ yellows"

---

## Strategy Tips

### Token Placement

1. **Plan for animals early:** Check animal card patterns before placing
2. **Don't isolate mountains:** They score 0 if not adjacent
3. **Multiple small fields > one large field:** 5 pts each regardless of size
4. **Buildings need diversity:** Place in central areas with varied neighbors
5. **Water is flexible:** Side A = one long river, Side B = create divisions

### Animal Cards

1. **Take cards early:** Get easier patterns first
2. **4-card limit:** Complete cards to free slots
3. **Overlap patterns:** Use same hexes for multiple animals when possible
4. **Cube permanence:** Patterns can be broken after placing cubes

### General Strategy

1. **Balance categories:** Don't focus only on one type
2. **Watch the pouch:** Game might end before board is full
3. **Token counting:** Remember distribution (23 blue, 19 green, etc.)
4. **Expansion planning:** Leave room for stacking and growth

## Common Mistakes

### Stacking Errors

- ❌ Placing yellow/blue on other tokens
- ❌ Stacking red as 3rd token
- ❌ More than 2 brown in a tree
- ❌ Brown stacking on non-brown tokens

### Scoring Errors

- ❌ Counting isolated mountains
- ❌ Scoring field size instead of flat 5 pts
- ❌ Giving buildings 2×colors instead of flat 5 pts if 3+
- ❌ Forgetting brown trunks alone = 0 pts

### Rules Errors

- ❌ Stacking tokens under existing tokens
- ❌ Stacking on hexes with animal cubes
- ❌ Taking more than 1 animal card per turn
- ❌ Having more than 4 animal cards above board

---

## Solo Mode

### Setup Changes

- Use **solo side** of Central Board (3 spaces)
- Only **3 face-up Animal Cards** (not 5)

### Gameplay Changes

- **Start of each turn:** Remove all 6 tokens from Central Board (return to box)
- Draw 3 new tokens for each of the 3 spaces
- **Optional:** Instead of taking an animal card, you may discard one face-up card and replace it

### Scoring Goal

Count total suns earned:

**Suns from Score:**

- 40 pts = 1 sun
- 70 pts = 2 suns
- 90 pts = 3 suns
- 110 pts = 4 suns
- 130 pts = 5 suns
- 140 pts = 6 suns
- 150 pts = 7 suns
- 160 pts = 8 suns

**Bonus Suns:**

- +1 sun if using Side A of Personal Board
- +2 suns if not using Nature Spirit
- +1 sun if using Nature Spirit that scores groups

**Goal:** Maximize total suns earned

---

## Quick Reference

### Turn Order

1. Take 3 tokens (mandatory - any time during turn)
2. Take 1 animal card (optional - max once)
3. Place animal cubes (optional - multiple times)
4. Player can do these in any order

### Stacking Quick Check

- Yellow/Blue: Ground only
- Brown: On brown only (max 2)
- Green: On 1-2 brown only
- Gray: On gray only (max 3)
- Red: Alone OR as 2nd token (on brown/gray/red), never 3rd

### Scoring Quick Check

- Trees: 0/0/1/3/5 pts (brown/brown/green/brown+green/2brown+green)
- Mountains: 1/3/7 pts IF adjacent, else 0
- Fields: 5 pts per 2+ cluster
- Buildings: 5 pts IF 3+ neighbor colors
- Water A: 0/2/5/8/11/15/+4... (longest only)
- Water B: 5 pts per island
- Animals: Top visible number on card
